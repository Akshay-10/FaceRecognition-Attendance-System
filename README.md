Smart Authorizing System, this project is the attendance system using face. The moto of this project is to mark the attendance without any physical contact and make it faster and make the process faster and reduces the waiting time. It is most efficient system which uses face recognition technology.  
This project is built using python language. This system automatically marks the attendance, the employee can just walk in and the system recognize his face and automatically marks the attendance. This system uses the cloud storage to store the attendance report and employee information. The admin has the primary permission to access the employee data and the system. The details of the employee can be altered only by the admin. 
This system reduces the spread of virus and it reduces the human error. Attendance system built based on the local binary pattern histogram algorithm. This system uses the machine learning method to predict and recognize the face. \The face recognition system does not recognize the duplicate faces like images. The liveness detection has been implemented to find the fake face. This system stops the marking of proxy attendance.
